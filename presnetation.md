What is cloud
computing?
‚Ä¢ Cloud computing is the
  delivery of computing
  services over the internet
  ("the cloud")
Think of it as a "Pizza as a Service" üçï

 Making Pizza at
                                                                    Cook everything
Home (Traditional   Buy all ingredients       Own an oven                                     Clean up after

  Computing)



  Ordering Pizza      Order what you         Pay for what you                                  No cleanup
                                                                   No kitchen needed
(Cloud Computing)         need                      eat                                         required



                Key Point: Just like you don't need a pizza oven at home, you don‚Äôt usually
                                         need servers in your office!
                ‚Ä¢ Let's Stick to Our Pizza Analogy!
                  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
                ‚Ä¢ Like renting a kitchen
                ‚Ä¢ You bring ingredients and cook

Cloud Service   ‚Ä¢ Example: Amazon EC2 - your virtual kitchen!
                ‚Ä¢ Platform as a Service (PaaS)

   Models       ‚Ä¢ Like having the kitchen and basic ingredients
                ‚Ä¢ You just follow the recipe
                ‚Ä¢ Example: Heroku - ready to cook!
                ‚Ä¢ Software as a Service (SaaS)
                ‚Ä¢ Like ordering a ready-made pizza
                ‚Ä¢ Just eat and enjoy
                ‚Ä¢ Example: Gmail - ready to use!
‚Ä¢ It's Just Like a   Understanding
  Postal System!
  üì¨                  Computer
                     Networks
The OSI Model
Explained
Think of sending a letter to
your friend:
Layer 1 (Physical) - The
Road

‚Ä¢ Like the actual roads and paths
‚Ä¢ In networks: Actual cables and wireless
  signals
‚Ä¢ "How does the message physically travel?"
Layer 2 (Data Link) -
The Local Post Office
‚Ä¢ Like addressing letters to local addresses
‚Ä¢ In networks: MAC addresses, local
  network
‚Ä¢ "How do devices talk within the same
  neighborhood?"
Layer 3 (Network) -
The National Postal
System
‚Ä¢ Like the system that routes between cities
‚Ä¢ In networks: IP addresses, routing
‚Ä¢ Famous example: "How does a letter get
  from New York to LA?"
Layer 4 (Transport) -
Package Types
‚Ä¢ Like choosing between regular mail or
  express delivery
‚Ä¢ TCP: Like certified mail (reliable,
  tracked)
‚Ä¢ UDP: Like regular mail (faster but no
  guarantees)
‚Ä¢ "How do we ensure the package arrives
  correctly?"
Layer 7 (Application) -
The Letter Content
‚Ä¢ Like the actual message you write
‚Ä¢ In networks: HTTP, FTP, SSH
‚Ä¢ "What are you actually trying to
  communicate?"
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
      Your Private City in the Cloud üåÜ
Understanding VPC:
Think of a Building
Public Cloud = Public City
‚Ä¢ Everyone shares streets
‚Ä¢ Public transportation
‚Ä¢ Open businesses
‚Ä¢ Shared resources
VPC = Private Building
‚Ä¢ Private roads
‚Ä¢ Controlled entrances
‚Ä¢ Your own rules
‚Ä¢ Custom layout
‚Ä¢ Complete isolation
IP Addresses & Subnets
    Think of a Large Office Building üè¢
IP Addresses



     Like room numbers in a      192.168.1.1 is like saying
     building                    "Floor 192, Room 1‚Äù




     Public IP: The building's   Private IP: The room
     street address              number inside
Subnets




  LIKE DIVIDING THE   MARKETING: FLOOR 1   ENGINEERING: FLOOR   EACH FLOOR HAS ITS
    BUILDING INTO                                  2             OWN NUMBERING
    DEPARTMENTS                                                      SYSTEM
Public Subnet (Tourist Area) Shops facing
main road
‚Ä¢ Visitor centers
‚Ä¢ Public services
‚Ä¢ Example: Web servers
Private Subnet (Employees Area) Behind
security
‚Ä¢ No direct outside access
‚Ä¢ Internal services only
‚Ä¢ Example: Databases
Internet Gateway =
Main Gate



‚Ä¢ Controls entry/exit
‚Ä¢ Security checkpoint
‚Ä¢ Public access point
‚Ä¢ Like a guarded entrance
NAT Gateway =
Employee Entrance


‚Ä¢ One-way access
‚Ä¢ Private areas can reach internet
‚Ä¢ Internet can't reach private areas
‚Ä¢ Like a secure exit door
Network ACLs =
Building Rules



‚Ä¢ Like organisation laws
‚Ä¢ Apply to entire building ALLOW or DENY
‚Ä¢ Stateless (checks both ways, on entry
  and exit)
Security Groups =
Department Rules
‚Ä¢ Like security alarms
‚Ä¢ Apply to specific departments/rooms
‚Ä¢ ALLOW only
‚Ä¢ Stateful (remember good visitors)
VPC Peering
Without Peering
‚Ä¢ Drive through public roads
‚Ä¢ Longer route
‚Ä¢ Less secure
‚Ä¢ More expensive
With Peering
‚Ä¢ Private direct roads
‚Ä¢ Secure connection
‚Ä¢ Fast access
‚Ä¢ Cost-effective
Load Balancers

Like a Smart Restaurant Host Ô∏è
Without Load Balancer:
‚Ä¢ One waiter serving all tables
‚Ä¢ Gets overwhelmed during rush hour
‚Ä¢ If sick, restaurant stops
With Load Balancer:
‚Ä¢ Host directs customers to free tables
‚Ä¢ Spreads crowd evenly
‚Ä¢ If one section is full, uses another
Reverse Proxies
What is a Reverse
Proxy?
 Proxy ‚Äì server doesn‚Äôt know
 clients IP
 reverse proxy is??

Like a Hotel Concierge üè®
‚Ä¢ Imagine a fancy hotel:
‚Ä¢ Guests (users) never go directly to hotel
  services
‚Ä¢ Everything goes through the concierge
  (reverse proxy)
‚Ä¢ Concierge knows exactly who can handle
  each request

                                                              overwhelmed
           Lets try a website?
                         Internet
                            ‚Üì
            Internet Gateway (Main Entrance)

     Private Subnet (Staff Only) - Application Servers
                            ‚Üì
        Private Subnet (Vault) - Database Servers
Compute in the cloud
‚Ä¢   Your Virtual Computer in the Cloud üíª
‚Ä¢   Example is EC2 and other VPS
‚Ä¢   Shared and dedicated
Small Instance
‚Ä¢   Studio apartment
‚Ä¢   Good for personal projects
‚Ä¢   Cheaper rent
Medium Instance
‚Ä¢   2-bedroom apartment
‚Ä¢   Perfect for small teams
‚Ä¢   Moderate cost
Large Instance
‚Ä¢   Penthouse suite
‚Ä¢   For big applications
‚Ä¢   Premium pricing


Cool Feature: You can "move apartments" (scale) anytime!
